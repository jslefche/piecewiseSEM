\title{
Updates basis set under certain conditions.
}

\description{
A helper function for \code{sem.missing.paths} that reverses independence claims between intermediate endogenous variables fit to non-normal distributions.
} 

\usage{
endogenous.reverse(basis.set, modelList, add.vars)
}

\arguments{
  \item{basis.set}{
a \code{list} of tests of conditional independence claims obtained from \code{sem.basis.set}.
}

\item{modelList}{
a \code{list} of regressions representing the structural equation model. 
}

  \item{add.vars}{
a vector of additional variables whose independence claims should be evaluated, but which do not appear in the model list.
}

}

\value{
Returns a \code{list} of conditional independence claims. The list contains duplicated entries, reversing the independence claims between endogenous variables that also predict other variables in the model *only if* those variables are fitted to a non-normal distribution.

This is a temporary workaround for GLM(M)s that do not adhere to the property of symmetricity of independence claims as a function of transformations via the link function.
