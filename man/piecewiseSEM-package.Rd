\title{
Piecewise Structural Equation Modeling
}

\description{
Implements piecewise structural equation modeling in R, complete with goodness-of-fit tests and retrieval of model coefficients. Compared with traditional variance-covariance based SEM, piecewise SEM allows for fitting of models to different distributions and/or incorporates hierarchical/nested random structures.

Supported model classes include: `lm`, `rq`, `glm`, `glm.nb`, `gls`, `pgls`, `merMod`, `merModLmerTest`, `lme`, `glmmPQL`, `glmmadmb`, and `glmmTMB`.

The primary functions in the package are \code{\link{sem.fit}} which performs goodness-of-fit tests, and \code{\link{sem.coefs}} which returns path coefficients (standardized, if specified) and standard errors.
